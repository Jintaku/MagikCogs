# MagikCogs

Magik Cogs are for Red-DiscordBot v2. Red-DiscordBot is a multipurpose bot for Discord developed by Twentysix26.
To submit an idea for a cog, DM me on discord. You can always find me at the official server for Red or you can find me on my own Support Server here: https://discord.gg/kQjTw5Z

Sadly, making and maintaining these cogs costs time, but no money. They're all made in my free time when I'm not doing anything else. But if you have Patreon, and you like my cogs, would you kindly think about donating some spare change by following the following link: https://www.patreon.com/magikbot and I thank you. :)

The MagikCogs Repo is public and anyone is welcome to use these cogs with their own version of Red-DiscordBot v, however, keep in mind, they were designed or modified for use with Magik Bot.
